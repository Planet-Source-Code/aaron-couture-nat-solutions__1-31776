### Description

NAT Solutions are a collection of NAT (Network Address Translation) programs that I have written. This includes a TCP Portmapper, UDP Portmapper, and a TCP Router. When used correctly these programs can allow Network computers access to internet Ports/IPs or even more!

This is the only NAT(Network Address Translation)/ICS(Internet Connection Sharing) code you will find on PSC. I am the only one that even atempted to write this software and post it!

Here is a list of all the programs included in the download and their functions/examples of how to use them:

TCP portmapper:

Maps a Specific LAN Port to a specific Internet port.

Example of use:

1) Set Internet IP to 216.239.33.100

2) Set Private IP(LAN IP) to 127.0.0.1

3) Set Port to 80

4) Open Webbrowser to http://localhost

You just made your computer a private Google

Server!

UDP portmapper:

Maps a specified Interent UDP port to specific UDP LAN Port.

Example of use:

N/A - Dont know any apps that use UDP protocol

Router:

Maps a specific Internet/Private IP to a specific Port.

Example Of Use:

1) Set IP to 216.239.33.100

2) Set Port to 80

You just made your computer a Google Server!(Any computer - even on the net can acces google by typing http://[Internet IP] - If your IP is Public(Internet IP)!
